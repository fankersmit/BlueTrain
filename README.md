# BlueTrain

Project demonstrating the possibilities of ansering a question, by visting different terminals with information holding and processing power.
It is inspired by he vision of the Dutch PHT project.
It concentrates on the routing and ordering problems in a distributed environment.
Possible uses are data processing without  actually having the data yourself. 

# The story

A ***question*** is packaged into a ***container***. The container travels through any number of ***terminals***. This is called a ***journey***. Each terminal adds infomration or processes information which together constitutes the answer. Traveling from one terminal to another is called a ***trip***. The journey itself is logged onto a ***routing slip***.
